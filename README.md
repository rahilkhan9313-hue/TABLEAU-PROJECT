Zomato – Data Fusion & Restaurant Analysis

 

Description

 

Zomato is a leading online food delivery platform that connects customers with a wide range of restaurants. With a vast network of partner restaurants, Zomato aims to offer diverse culinary options to its users. The dataset provided includes two tables: "Location" and "Rating." The "Location" table contains crucial information about restaurants, such as their names, locations, cuisines, and cities. The "Rating" table provides insights into restaurant performance, including ratings, votes, and cost details. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for Zomato to analyze restaurant data and gain insights into customer preferences, allowing for better decision-making and strategy formulation.

 


 

As a data analyst at Zomato, your primary responsibility is to analyze the provided dataset and extract meaningful insights. Begin by importing the dataset into Tableau and performing a data join operation to combine the "Location" and "Rating" tables based on a

 

 

suitable join key, such as the restaurant ID. This join will create a unified dataset that incorporates information about restaurant locations, cuisines, ratings, votes, and costs.

 

The analysis of the combined dataset can provide valuable insights to inform Zomato's strategy and decision-making processes. Start by examining the distribution of restaurants across different locations and cities. Create a table visualization in Tableau to showcase the number of restaurants in each city, sorted in descending order. This will help identify cities with a high concentration of restaurants and guide Zomato's marketing efforts and restaurant partnerships.
